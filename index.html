                <p>A little less than a year ago.
                    I wrote my first HTML code, then CSS and
                    the journey has continued on from there.
                    I am self-taught coder ready to help
                    you design your next dynamic and
                    interactive website. I am highly
                    self-motivated and will deliver
                    high-quality product. I look forward to helping
                    you design and build your next webpage!</p>
